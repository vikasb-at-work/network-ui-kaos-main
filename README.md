# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.  Prerequisite
    1.  Development IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)
    2.  Python 3.6 Installed + VirtualEnv
        ### Installing Python3 on Linux
        Step 1: Open a Terminal and add the repository to your Yum install.
	    ```sudo yum install -y https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm```
        Step 2: Update Yum to finish adding the repository.
	    ```sudo yum update```
        Step 3: Download and install Python. This will not only install Python â€“ but it will also install pip to help you with installing add-ons.
	    ```sudo yum install -y python36u python36u-libs python36u-devel python36u-pip```
        Verify: Once these commands are executed, simply check if the correct version of Python has been installed by executing the following command:
        ```python3.6 -V```

        ### Installing Python3 on Windows
        Request for PyCharm or Python IDLE using the go/remedy

    3.  Git
        Visual Studio Code has GIT installed in it.
        If you are using linux use 
        ```sudo yum install git```
